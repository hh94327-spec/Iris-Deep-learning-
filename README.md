# Iris-Deep-learning-
We built an end-to-end Iris classifier using Keras. Steps: data loading, scaling, one-hot encoding → model design &amp; training → TensorBoard visualization → Bayesian hyperparameter tuning → final evaluation (Confusion/ROC/PR) → Streamlit app for live prediction with saved model and preprocess artifacts.
